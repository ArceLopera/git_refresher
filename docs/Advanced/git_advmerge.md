### Merge Conflicts
Merge conflicts occur when Git is unable to automatically resolve differences between branches. You can resolve conflicts manually by editing the conflicting files and then committing the changes.

```bash
git merge feature-branch
# Resolve conflicts in conflicted files
git add <resolved-file>
git commit
```

### Aborting a Merge
If you encounter issues during a merge and want to abort the process, you can use `git merge --abort`.

```bash
git merge --abort
```

### Ignoring Whitespace
To ignore whitespace changes during a merge, you can use the `-Xignore-space-change` or `-Xignore-all-space` option.

```bash
git merge -Xignore-space-change feature-branch
```

### Manual File Re-merging
If you need to re-merge a file manually after resolving conflicts, you can use `git checkout --ours` or `git checkout --theirs`.

```bash
git checkout --ours <file>
git checkout --theirs <file>
```

### Checking Out Conflicts
To view the conflicting changes in a file, you can use `git checkout --conflict`.

```bash
git checkout --conflict <file>
```

### Merge Log
To view the history of merges in your repository, you can use `git log --merges`.

```bash
git log --merges
```

### Combined Diff Format
The combined diff format shows changes from multiple branches in a single diff output.

```bash
git diff --combined
```

### Undoing Merges
To undo a merge commit and reset the branch to its state before the merge, you can use `git reset --hard`.

```bash
git reset --hard HEAD^
```

### Fix the References
If you need to fix the references after a failed merge, you can manually update the references in the `.git/refs` directory.

### Reverse the Commit
To reverse a merge commit, you can use `git revert`.

```bash
git revert -m 1 <merge-commit>
```

### Our or Theirs Preference
During a merge, you can specify whether to prefer changes from the current branch (`--ours`) or the merged branch (`--theirs`).

```bash
git merge -Xours feature-branch
git merge -Xtheirs feature-branch
```

### Subtree Merging
Subtree merging involves merging in changes from one branch into a subdirectory of another branch.

```bash
git merge --squash --no-commit feature-branch
git read-tree --prefix=subdir/ -u feature-branch
git commit -m "Merge feature-branch into subdir"
```

These advanced merging techniques provide you with greater control and flexibility when managing merges in your Git repository, allowing you to handle complex merging scenarios efficiently.
