After installing Git, the next step is to configure it with your user information. This ensures that your commits are associated with the correct identity. Follow these steps to configure Git with your user information used across all local repositories:

## 1. **Open a Terminal/Command Prompt**
   - **Windows:** Git Bash, Command Prompt, or PowerShell.
   - **macOS/Linux:** Terminal.

## 2. **Set Your Username**
   Run the following command, replacing "Your Name" with your actual name:
   ```bash
   git config --global user.name "firstname Lastname"
   ```

## 3. **Set Your Email Address**
   Run the following command, replacing "your.email@example.com" with your actual email address:
   ```bash
   git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
   ```

## 4. **Configure Line Endings**
   To prevent line ending issues when collaborating across different platforms, set your preferred line ending configuration. For Unix-style line endings (LF), run:
   ```bash
   git config --global core.autocrlf input
   ```
   For Windows-style line endings (CRLF), run:
   ```bash
   git config --global core.autocrlf true
   ```

## 5. **Configure Text Editor (Optional)**
   Set your preferred text editor for Git. For example, to use VSCode:
   ```bash
   git config --global core.editor "code --wait"
   ```

## 6. **Enable Color Output**
Improve readability by enabling color output in the Git command line:

   ```bash
   git config --global color.ui auto
   ```
This setting adds color to various Git outputs, making it easier to distinguish between different types of information.To view your Git configuration, run:

## 7. **Check Configuration**
   To view your Git configuration, run:
   ```bash
   git config --list
   ```

   Ensure that your name, email, and other settings are correctly displayed.

## 8. **Verify Configuration**
   Run the following commands to verify your configuration:
   ```bash
   git config user.name
   git config user.email
   ```

   These commands should display the values you've just set.

## Additional Tips

- **Credential Caching**
  To avoid entering your credentials repeatedly, you can set up credential caching. On Windows, Git Credential Manager is often used. On macOS/Linux, you can use the credential helper provided by Git:
  ```bash
  git config --global credential.helper cache
  ```

- **SSH Key**
  If you prefer using SSH for authentication, [generate an SSH key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh) and [associate it with your GitHub account](../Github/git_ssh.md).

Your Git configuration is now set up. You can start using Git with your personalized settings for version control and collaboration.
