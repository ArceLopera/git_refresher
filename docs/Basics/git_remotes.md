Working with remotes in Git involves collaborating with repositories hosted on remote servers.

## 3. **Fetching Changes from a Remote**

```bash
git fetch <remote-name>
```
```bash
git fetch origin

## 4. **Pulling Changes from a Remote**

```bash
git pull <remote-name> <branch-name>

```bash
git pull origin main

## 5. **Pushing Changes to a Remote**

```bash
git push <remote-name> <branch-name>
```

```bash
git push origin main
```

## 6. **Creating a Branch in a Remote Repository**

```bash
